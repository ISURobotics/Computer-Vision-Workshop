# Computer-Vision-Workshop
Introduction to OpenCV, an open source computer vision library.  Computer vision's popularity in robotics, data analytics, and beyond is rapidly growing.  This workshop's goal is to introduce you to the basics of OpenCV and Python so you can get up and running on your own.

Requirements:
1.  Windows 10 PC.  You can try on Mac, just can't guarantee it'll work.
2.  Webcam.  Can be built in or not.  Doesn't matter.
3.  Python 2.7
4.  OpenCV 3.2.0
5.  Text editor of choice. IDLE or Notepad++ work great.
6.  Brightly colored object (tennis ball?)

Follow the OpenCV/Python Installation Guide given in this repository.
